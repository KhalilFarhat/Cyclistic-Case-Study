# Cyclistic-Case-Study
This is a case study for one of the capstone projects for Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

Cyclistic is a fictitious bike-sharing corporation situated in Chicago.

The management team is looking for new ways to drive growth and is considering a marketing campaign aimed at converting a large share of casual passengers into members.

As a junior data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing analytics team, I'm responsible for presenting my results and recommendations to executives after extensively exploring, processing, and analyzing any relevant data.

The written report on my data analysis process may be found in the cyclistic-case-study file linked above.
